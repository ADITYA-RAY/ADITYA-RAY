        <p>
          Although I am a full stack Web developer, I love making beautiful UI's
          the most. Web Developement is more of a hobby than a profession for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked with a vast set of web technologies over the period of
          an year since I started learning to make websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opportunity to learn something new every day is what acts as a
          fuel that drives me forward.
